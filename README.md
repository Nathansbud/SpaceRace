# Space Race

Space Race was, and still is, my favorite means of learning vocabulary. Forcing you to think quickly in order to input definitions was just fun, I don't know. But, since Quizlet removed Space Race and replaced it with Gravity a few years back, I've hardly used the platform. So, I think the only solution here is to make my own remake of Space Race, yo!
